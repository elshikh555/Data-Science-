# Data-Science-
Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data. It combines expertise from various domains such as statistics, computer science, mathematics, and domain-specific fields to analyze, interpret, and visualize data.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:


Handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming raw data into a format suitable for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Investigating and visualizing data patterns, relationships, and trends to gain initial insights and guide further analysis

Machine Learning:


Building and training models to make predictions or classifications. Common machine learning tasks include regression, classification, clustering, and recommendation systems.

Data Visualization:


Creating informative and visually appealing charts, graphs, and dashboards to communicate findings and insights to both technical and non-technical audiences.
